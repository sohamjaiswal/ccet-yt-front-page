# YT Clone
This is a basic clone of the desktop youtube front page made purely in HTML, JS and CSS. It supports light mode and dark mode and has a few interactive buttons.

This has been made as a task which was required to be done to be added to the developer team of College's Festival.

# Usage
The project isn't actually usable as it's just a mockup of the site made as per requirements given prior. To view the single page that it has, 
- you can clone this repository using 
  `git clone https://github.com/sohamjaiswal/ccet-yt-front-page`
- cd into the project directory
- `cd code`
- Now, if you are using visual studio code, you may open it using Live Server extension of VSCode, opened (generally) via `code .` or host via python using, `python -m http.server` (windows) or `python3 -m http.server` (macOS/Linux) 
-   | Server                | Default Port |
    |-----------------------|--------------|
    | Live Server Extension | 5500         |
    | Python http.server    | 8000         |

# Scope to make it real
The styling of almost everything on this page has been kept very modular and is easily mutable. It shouldn't be much of a problem to be able to refactor this into valid react or svelte code.
